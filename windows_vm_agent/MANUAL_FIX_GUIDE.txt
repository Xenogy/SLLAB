WINDOWS VM AGENT CONFIG FIX GUIDE
===========================

The Windows VM Agent fails to initialize due to an issue with backslashes in file paths in the config.yaml file.
This guide explains how to fix the issue manually.

PROBLEM:
--------
In YAML files, backslashes (\) are used as escape characters. When Windows file paths with backslashes are used
in a YAML file, they're interpreted as escape sequences. The error occurs because '\C' is not a valid escape sequence.

SOLUTION:
---------
You have three options to fix this issue:

1. RECOMMENDED: Replace backslashes with forward slashes
   Example: Change "C:\CsBotAgent\action_scripts" to "C:/CsBotAgent/action_scripts"
   
   Windows accepts forward slashes in file paths in most contexts, and this is the most portable solution.

2. Double the backslashes
   Example: Change "C:\CsBotAgent\action_scripts" to "C:\\CsBotAgent\\action_scripts"
   
   This tells YAML to interpret the first backslash as an escape character for the second backslash.

3. Use single quotes instead of double quotes
   Example: Change "C:\CsBotAgent\action_scripts" to 'C:\CsBotAgent\action_scripts'
   
   Single quotes in YAML don't process escape sequences, so backslashes are treated literally.

STEPS TO FIX MANUALLY:
---------------------
1. Open C:\CsBotAgent\config.yaml in a text editor (like Notepad, Notepad++, or VS Code)

2. Find all Windows file paths that use backslashes (\) and replace them using one of the methods above
   Common locations to check:
   - ScriptsPath under General section
   - LogFilePath under each EventMonitor

3. Save the file and run the agent again using run_agent.bat

EXAMPLE:
--------
Original (problematic):
  ScriptsPath: "C:\CsBotAgent\action_scripts"
  
Fixed (using forward slashes):
  ScriptsPath: "C:/CsBotAgent/action_scripts"

AUTOMATED FIX:
-------------
If you prefer not to edit the file manually, you can use one of the provided scripts:

1. fix_config.bat - Simple batch file that creates a fixed config
2. fix_config.ps1 - PowerShell script that fixes the existing config (requires PowerShell-Yaml module)

Simply run one of these scripts from the C:\CsBotAgent directory.

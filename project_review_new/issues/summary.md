# Issues Summary

This document provides a summary of the issues identified in the AccountDB project. Each issue is categorized and prioritized based on its impact on the system.

## Database and RLS Issues

### High Priority

1. **Inconsistent RLS Implementation**
   - Description: Row-Level Security (RLS) is implemented inconsistently across endpoints
   - Impact: Users might be able to access data they shouldn't have access to
   - Example: Some endpoints use direct database connections that bypass RLS

2. **Direct Database Access Bypassing RLS**
   - Description: Some endpoints use direct database connections that bypass RLS
   - Impact: Security vulnerability allowing unauthorized access to data
   - Example: The `/proxmox-nodes/agent-vms/{node_id}` endpoint uses a direct database connection

3. **Inconsistent Database Connection Patterns**
   - Description: Different patterns are used for database connections throughout the codebase
   - Impact: Makes the code harder to maintain and increases the risk of security issues
   - Example: Some endpoints use `get_db_connection()` while others use `get_user_db_connection()`

### Medium Priority

1. **Missing RLS Policies for Some Operations**
   - Description: Some operations don't have proper RLS policies
   - Impact: Potential security issues in specific scenarios
   - Example: Some INSERT operations don't check ownership

2. **No Database Migration System**
   - Description: The project doesn't use a database migration system
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to track and apply schema changes
   - Example: Schema changes are applied directly in SQL files

### Low Priority

1. **Inefficient Database Queries**
   - Description: Some database queries are not optimized
   - Impact: Performance issues with large datasets
   - Example: Some queries retrieve more data than needed

## API Design Issues

### High Priority

1. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Description: Error handling is inconsistent across endpoints
   - Impact: Makes debugging difficult and can lead to unclear error messages for users
   - Example: Some endpoints use try/except blocks while others don't

2. **Direct SQL Queries in Endpoints**
   - Description: Many endpoints contain direct SQL queries instead of using a data access layer
   - Impact: Makes the code harder to maintain and test
   - Example: Most endpoints contain SQL queries directly in the handler function

3. **Lack of Comprehensive Input Validation**
   - Description: Input validation is inconsistent and sometimes missing
   - Impact: Potential security vulnerabilities and data integrity issues
   - Example: Some endpoints don't validate all input parameters

### Medium Priority

1. **Inconsistent Response Formats**
   - Description: API responses have inconsistent formats
   - Impact: Makes it harder for frontend developers to work with the API
   - Example: Some endpoints return lists while others return objects with metadata

2. **Missing API Documentation**
   - Description: API endpoints are not well-documented
   - Impact: Makes it harder for developers to understand and use the API
   - Example: Missing OpenAPI/Swagger documentation

### Low Priority

1. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**
   - Description: Naming conventions are inconsistent across the codebase
   - Impact: Makes the code harder to understand and maintain
   - Example: Some endpoints use snake_case while others use camelCase

## Proxmox Integration Issues

### High Priority

1. **Hardcoded Configuration in Proxmox Host Agent**
   - Description: The Proxmox host agent has hardcoded configuration values
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to deploy in different environments
   - Example: The port is hardcoded to 8000

2. **Limited Error Handling in Proxmox Host Agent**
   - Description: Error handling in the Proxmox host agent is limited
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to diagnose and recover from errors
   - Example: Some exceptions are caught but not properly handled

3. **No Automatic Reconnection Logic**
   - Description: The Proxmox host agent doesn't automatically reconnect if AccountDB is temporarily unavailable
   - Impact: Requires manual intervention if the connection is lost
   - Example: The agent fails if it can't connect to AccountDB

### Medium Priority

1. **Inefficient Whitelist Implementation**
   - Description: The whitelist implementation could be more efficient
   - Impact: Performance issues with large whitelists
   - Example: The whitelist is retrieved on every sync

2. **Limited Logging in Proxmox Host Agent**
   - Description: Logging in the Proxmox host agent is limited
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to diagnose issues
   - Example: Some errors are not logged properly

### Low Priority

1. **No Health Checks for Proxmox Nodes**
   - Description: There are no health checks for Proxmox nodes
   - Impact: Makes it difficult to monitor the health of Proxmox nodes
   - Example: No endpoint to check if a Proxmox node is healthy

## Frontend Issues

### High Priority

1. **Debug Console Logs in Production Code**
   - Description: There are debug console logs in production code
   - Impact: Clutters the console and potentially exposes sensitive information
   - Example: Console logs in the VM management page

2. **Inconsistent Error Handling**
   - Description: Error handling is inconsistent across components
   - Impact: Poor user experience when errors occur
   - Example: Some components show error messages while others don't

3. **Limited Form Validation**
   - Description: Form validation is limited and inconsistent
   - Impact: Poor user experience and potential data integrity issues
   - Example: Some forms don't validate input before submission

### Medium Priority

1. **Inline Styles Instead of Design System**
   - Description: Some components use inline styles instead of the design system
   - Impact: Inconsistent UI and harder maintenance
   - Example: Inline styles in the VM management page

2. **Inconsistent Loading States**
   - Description: Loading states are inconsistent across components
   - Impact: Poor user experience during loading
   - Example: Some components show loading indicators while others don't

### Low Priority

1. **No Responsive Design for Some Components**
   - Description: Some components don't have proper responsive design
   - Impact: Poor user experience on mobile devices
   - Example: The VM management page doesn't adapt well to small screens

## Testing Issues

### High Priority

1. **Limited Test Coverage**
   - Description: The project has limited test coverage

   - Impact: Increases the risk of integration issues
   - Example: No tests for critical workflows

3. **No Integration Tests for Proxmox Host Agent**

   - Impact: Increases the risk of integration issues
   - Example: No tests for the synchronization process

### Medium Priority

1. **No Performance Tests**
   - Description: There are no performance tests
   - Impact: Increases the risk of performance issues
   - Example: No tests for database performance with large datasets

### Low Priority

1. **No Test Documentation**
   - Description: There is no documentation for tests
   - Impact: Makes it harder for developers to understand and run tests
   - Example: No README for tests

## Documentation Issues

### High Priority

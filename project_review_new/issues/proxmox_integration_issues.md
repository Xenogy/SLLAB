# Proxmox Integration Issues

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Hardcoded Configuration in Proxmox Host Agent

**Description:**  
The Proxmox host agent has hardcoded configuration values in several places, making it difficult to deploy in different environments without code changes.

**Impact:**  
This makes it difficult to deploy the agent in different environments and requires code changes for configuration, which is error-prone and not maintainable.

**Examples:**
- The port is hardcoded to 8000 in main.py
- Some API endpoints are hardcoded
- Default configuration values are scattered throughout the code

**Code Example:**
```python
# Hardcoded port in main.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Register signal handlers
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, handle_sigterm)

    # Run the application
    uvicorn.run(
        "main:app",
        host="0.0.0.0",
        port=8000,
        reload=config.debug,
    )
```

**Recommended Fix:**
- Move all configuration to environment variables or a configuration file
- Create a centralized configuration module
- Add command-line arguments for overriding configuration
- Document all configuration options

### 2. Limited Error Handling in Proxmox Host Agent

**Description:**  
Error handling in the Proxmox host agent is limited and inconsistent. Some errors are caught and logged, but recovery mechanisms are minimal.

**Impact:**  
This makes it difficult to diagnose and recover from errors, potentially leading to service disruptions.

**Examples:**
- Some exceptions are caught but not properly handled
- No retry mechanism for transient errors
- Inconsistent error logging
- No alerting for critical errors

**Code Example:**
```python
try:
    # Get VMs from Proxmox
    vms = proxmox_client.get_vms()
    logger.info(f"Retrieved {len(vms)} VMs from Proxmox")
except Exception as e:
    # Error caught but no recovery mechanism
    logger.error(f"Error during VM synchronization: {e}")
```

**Recommended Fix:**
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add retry mechanisms for transient errors
- Standardize error logging
- Add alerting for critical errors
- Implement graceful degradation for non-critical components

### 3. No Automatic Reconnection Logic

**Description:**  
The Proxmox host agent doesn't automatically reconnect if AccountDB is temporarily unavailable.

**Impact:**  
This requires manual intervention if the connection is lost, potentially leading to service disruptions.

**Examples:**
- No retry mechanism for failed connections
- No exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- No health check for the AccountDB connection

**Code Example:**
```python
async def verify_connection():
    """Verify the connection to the AccountDB API."""
    try:
        logger.info("Verifying connection to AccountDB")
        success = await accountdb_client.verify_connection()
        if success:
            logger.info("Connection to AccountDB verified successfully")
        else:
            logger.error("Failed to verify connection to AccountDB")
        return success
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error verifying connection to AccountDB: {e}")
        return False
```

**Recommended Fix:**
- Implement automatic reconnection logic
- Add exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Add health checks for the AccountDB connection
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for handling persistent failures

## Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Inefficient Whitelist Implementation

**Description:**  
The whitelist implementation could be more efficient. The whitelist is retrieved on every sync operation, and there's no efficient caching mechanism.

**Impact:**  
This can lead to performance issues, especially with large whitelists or frequent sync operations.

**Examples:**
- Whitelist is retrieved on every sync
- No efficient caching mechanism
- No bulk operations for whitelist management

**Code Example:**
```python
# Whitelist retrieved on every sync
try:
    whitelist = await accountdb_client.get_vmid_whitelist()
    whitelist_enabled = len(whitelist) > 0

    # Update whitelist cache and timestamp
    whitelist_cache = whitelist
    last_whitelist_update_time = int(time.time())

    logger.info(f"Retrieved whitelist with {len(whitelist)} VMIDs. Whitelist enabled: {whitelist_enabled}")
except Exception as e:
    # If we can't get the whitelist, use the cached version if available
    if len(whitelist_cache) > 0:
        logger.warning(f"Error retrieving whitelist, using cached version: {e}")
        whitelist = whitelist_cache
        whitelist_enabled = len(whitelist) > 0
    else:
        # If no cache is available, proceed without filtering
        logger.error(f"Error retrieving whitelist and no cache available: {e}")
        whitelist = []
        whitelist_enabled = False
```

**Recommended Fix:**
- Implement efficient whitelist caching
- Add conditional requests (If-Modified-Since) for whitelist retrieval
- Implement bulk operations for whitelist management
- Optimize whitelist filtering for large datasets

### 2. Limited Logging in Proxmox Host Agent

**Description:**  
Logging in the Proxmox host agent is limited and inconsistent. Some operations are well-logged, while others have minimal logging.

**Impact:**  
This makes it difficult to diagnose issues and monitor the agent's behavior.

**Examples:**
- Inconsistent log levels
- Some operations have minimal logging
- No structured logging
- No log rotation

**Code Example:**
```python
# Inconsistent log levels
logger.info("Starting VM synchronization")
# ...
logger.debug("Sending heartbeat to AccountDB")
```

**Recommended Fix:**
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Standardize log levels
- Add structured logging
- Implement log rotation
- Add metrics for monitoring

## Low Priority Issues

### 1. No Health Checks for Proxmox Nodes

**Description:**  
There are no health checks for Proxmox nodes. The agent doesn't monitor the health of the Proxmox API or the node itself.

**Impact:**  
This makes it difficult to monitor the health of Proxmox nodes and detect issues early.

**Examples:**
- No health check endpoint for Proxmox nodes
- No monitoring of Proxmox API health
- No alerting for Proxmox node issues

**Recommended Fix:**
- Implement health checks for Proxmox nodes
- Add monitoring of Proxmox API health
- Implement alerting for Proxmox node issues
- Add metrics for Proxmox node performance

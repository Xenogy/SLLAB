## Dependencies and Risks

### Dependencies

- **Phase 2** depends on the completion of **Phase 1** for standardized database access
- **Phase 3** depends on the completion of **Phase 2** for improved error handling
- **Phase 4** depends on the completion of **Phase 2** for consistent API responses
- **Phase 5** depends on the completion of **Phases 1-4** for stable code to test
- **Phase 6** depends on the completion of **Phases 1-5** for accurate documentation

### Risks

1. **Scope Creep**: The scope of improvements may expand as implementation progresses
   - **Mitigation**: Clearly define the scope of each phase and stick to it
   
2. **Technical Debt**: Existing technical debt may slow down implementation
   - **Mitigation**: Allocate time for addressing technical debt in each phase
   
3. **Resource Constraints**: Limited resources may impact the timeline
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize improvements based on impact and adjust timeline if needed
   
4. **Integration Issues**: Changes may cause integration issues with existing systems
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive testing for each change

## Monitoring and Reporting

Progress will be monitored and reported on a weekly basis, with the following metrics:

1. **Completed Tasks**: Number of tasks completed vs. planned
2. **Issues Found**: Number of issues found during implementation
3. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
4. **Performance Metrics**: Impact on application performance

## Conclusion

This implementation timeline provides a structured approach to improving the AccountDB project. By following this timeline, we can systematically address the issues identified in the project review and create a more secure, reliable, and maintainable application.

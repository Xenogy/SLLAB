# Current State Analysis

## Architecture

The project follows a modern architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Backend API with FastAPI**: Provides RESTful endpoints for all resources
- **Frontend with Next.js**: Provides a user interface for interacting with the API
- **PostgreSQL database with RLS**: Ensures data isolation between users
- **Proxmox integration via a dedicated agent**: Syncs VM information with AccountDB

The architecture is well-structured and follows modern best practices for web applications. The separation of concerns allows for independent development and deployment of each component.

## Database Schema

The database schema is well-designed with proper relationships between tables:

- **users**: Stores user information and authentication details
- **accounts**: Stores account information with owner_id for RLS
- **hardware**: Stores hardware information with owner_id for RLS
- **cards**: Stores card information with owner_id for RLS
- **vms**: Stores virtual machine information with owner_id for RLS
- **proxmox_nodes**: Stores Proxmox node information with owner_id for RLS

Each table has appropriate indexes and constraints, and all tables have owner_id columns for implementing Row-Level Security.

## Security Implementation

### Authentication

- JWT-based authentication for API access
- Token refresh mechanism
- Password hashing for user credentials

### Authorization

- Row-Level Security (RLS) implemented at the database level
- Owner-based access control for all resources
- Role-based access control (admin vs. regular users)

### API Security

- Input validation using Pydantic models
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (partially implemented)

## Feature Implementation

### Account Management

- CRUD operations for accounts
- Filtering and pagination
- Search functionality

### Hardware Management

- CRUD operations for hardware
- Filtering and pagination
- Search functionality

### Virtual Machine Management

- CRUD operations for VMs
- Integration with Proxmox
- VM status monitoring
- VMID whitelist for controlling which VMs are synced

### Proxmox Integration

- Proxmox node management
- VM synchronization
- API key authentication
- Whitelist management

## Frontend Implementation

- Modern UI with responsive design
- Dashboard for resource overview
- Management interfaces for all resources
- Authentication and authorization
- Error handling and notifications

## Testing

- Limited unit tests for backend
- No end-to-end tests
- No integration tests for Proxmox host agent

## Documentation

- Limited API documentation
- No comprehensive setup guide
- Missing architecture diagrams

## Deployment

- Docker Compose for local development
- No production deployment configuration
- No CI/CD pipeline

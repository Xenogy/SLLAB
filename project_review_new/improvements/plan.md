# Improvement Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive improvement plan for the AccountDB project. The plan is divided into six phases, each focusing on a specific area of improvement.

## Overview

The improvement plan is structured to address the issues identified in the project review in a systematic and prioritized manner. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring that foundational improvements are made first.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Database and RLS Improvements
Focus on improving the database structure and Row-Level Security implementation to ensure data security and integrity.

### Phase 2: API Improvements
Enhance the API design, error handling, and input validation to create a more robust and maintainable backend.

### Phase 3: Proxmox Integration Improvements
Improve the Proxmox host agent and integration to ensure reliable VM synchronization and management.

### Phase 4: Frontend Improvements
Enhance the user interface, error handling, and user experience to create a more polished and user-friendly application.

### Phase 5: Testing Improvements
Increase test coverage and implement comprehensive testing strategies to ensure application reliability.

### Phase 6: Documentation Improvements
Create comprehensive documentation for the API, setup process, and architecture to facilitate easier onboarding and maintenance.

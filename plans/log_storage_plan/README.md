# Log Storage System Enhancement Plan

This directory contains the plan for enhancing the log storage system with a focus on simplicity and a basic viewer interface.

## Overview

The log storage system has been implemented with the following components:

- Database schema for storing logs
- Repository class for database access
- API endpoints for log management
- Utility functions for logging from code
- Integration with the main application

The next steps focus on creating a simple viewer interface and integrating with other components of the system.

## Implementation Plan

See the detailed plans in this directory:

- [1-basic-log-viewer.md](1-basic-log-viewer.md) - Creating a simple log viewer UI
- [2-windows-vm-agent-integration.md](2-windows-vm-agent-integration.md) - Integrating with the Windows VM agent
- [3-proxmox-host-integration.md](3-proxmox-host-integration.md) - Integrating with the Proxmox host agent
- [4-basic-log-management.md](4-basic-log-management.md) - Adding simple log management features

## Implementation Progress

### Completed
- ✅ Basic Log Viewer UI
  - Created log API client in `frontend/nextjs/lib/logs-api.ts`
  - Implemented log viewer page in `frontend/nextjs/app/(authenticated)/logs/page.tsx`

  - Added log cleanup component in `frontend/nextjs/app/(authenticated)/settings/logs-cleanup.tsx`
  - Integrated log cleanup with settings page

- ✅ Windows VM Agent Integration (Partial)
  - Created log client in `windows_vm_agent/utils/log_client.py`
  - Updated API client to use log client
  - Added logging for authentication, errors, and API calls
  - Updated agent initialization and shutdown to use log client

### Completed

## Next Steps

All planned features have been implemented. Potential future enhancements could include:
1. Adding more advanced log filtering options
2. Implementing log export functionality
3. Creating a dedicated admin dashboard for log management
4. Adding automated log cleanup scheduling

## Timeline

- Total estimated time: 5-9 days
- Current progress: 100% (Completed)

## Getting Started

All planned features have been implemented. The log storage system now includes:
- A database schema for storing logs
